# Features to Consider

## Features That Could Amplify the Concept

### The Creator Partnership Model — this is the biggest unlock

Right now you're sourcing recipes from creators but they get nothing. Flip that. Reach out to food creators and offer them a revenue share — say 2-3% of every dish sold that's based on their recipe.

The upside is enormous:
- @GrillDaddy gets a monthly check because his smash burger is on your menu
- He tells his 4M followers to go try *his dish* at Social Proof
- His audience becomes your marketing
- You go from a restaurant that uses viral recipes to **the restaurant that pays creators for their recipes**

That's a completely different story — and a genuinely novel creator economy model nobody has done at the brick-and-mortar level.

### The Trial Slot

Reserve one permanent menu slot called "The Challenger." It's always occupied by a brand new dish on a 30-day trial. Guests know going in that this dish might not survive. It creates a reason to come back and check what's in the slot, and it makes ordering it feel like participation in something.

If it hits 4.2+ stars by end of month, it earns a permanent spot. If not, it's gone. You announce the results publicly.

### The Retirement Event

When a dish gets retired, make it a moment. "The Baked Feta Pasta is retiring Friday. Last chance." Post about it. This creates urgency and FOMO — people who never came in might show up specifically for the farewell. It also makes the *next* dish's arrival feel like an opening night.

### Live Leaderboard in the Space

A screen somewhere visible in the restaurant showing real-time dish rankings — updated throughout the day. Not just aesthetic. It changes what people order. If guests see the Birria Tacos pulling away in real time, they want in on it. This also makes the data tangible in a way a menu card can't.

### "I Was There First" Mechanic

When a dish is new, early reviewers get a small badge on their review — "Day 1 review." People love being early adopters. It gives a reason to come back when new dishes drop and to be first to rate them.

---

### Social Proof's Own Content

The restaurant itself should be a content machine. Document the journey from viral video to actual menu dish — what had to change to make it work at scale, what didn't translate, what surprised the kitchen. That behind-the-scenes content is genuinely interesting and nobody else can make it. The restaurant feeds the socials, the socials feed the restaurant.

## Things to Be Mindful Of

### Menu Size Discipline

The concept tempts you to keep adding dishes. Resist it. A tight menu of 18-24 items is easier to execute, easier to market, and makes the retirement mechanic feel meaningful. Too many dishes and nothing feels scarce or special.

### The Kitchen Pipeline

The hardest operational challenge: going from "this video went viral" to "this dish is on our menu" in a reasonable timeframe. You need a test-kitchen process — recipe adaptation, costing, training, sourcing ingredients. If that pipeline takes 3 months, you'll always feel behind the trend curve. Think about how to compress it.

### Getting Reviews Is Harder Than It Looks

The whole concept depends on review volume. A dish with 3 reviews means nothing. You'll need a frictionless, well-timed prompt — probably a text/QR at the end of the meal, maybe a small incentive (10% off your next visit for completing reviews). Make it feel like contribution, not a survey.

### Radical Transparency Has a Floor

The lean-into-feedback philosophy is great, but you need to be prepared for a rough opening stretch when ratings are low across the board simply because everything is new. Set expectations: "We just launched. Everything you see is real. Watch us get better." That framing actually makes low early ratings part of the story.

### Recipe Attribution and Creator Relations

Recipes themselves aren't copyrightable, but the relationship matters. If you're using someone's recipe without reaching out and then profiting from it, that could create bad press — especially in the creator community. Even a simple DM saying "we're putting your dish on our menu, here's a reservation" builds goodwill. The revenue share model above is the full solution.

## The Bigger Idea

The through-line on all of this: **Social Proof isn't just a restaurant, it's a feedback loop made physical.** The internet votes with views. Your guests vote with forks. The menu responds. If you can make that loop feel alive — visible in the space, felt in the experience, shared on social — you have something that's genuinely hard to copy because the *culture* of the place is the product, not just the food.
