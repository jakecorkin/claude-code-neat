**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

### Social Proof Opens Its Doors: The First Restaurant Where the Internet Builds the Menu and Guests Hold It Accountable

*A new dining concept launches with a menu sourced entirely from viral recipes — and the courage to let every guest rate every dish, publicly.*

**Salt Lake City, UT** — Social Proof, a first-of-its-kind restaurant concept, opens today at 123 S Main Street, Salt Lake City. The restaurant takes a radical approach to both menu design and guest experience: every dish on the menu started as a viral video, and every dish is rated publicly by the guests who eat it — with the lowest performers replaced in real time.

For decades, restaurant menus have operated on a simple assumption: the chef decides what's good, and guests either return or don't. Feedback, when it exists at all, is buried in aggregate star ratings on third-party platforms that say nothing about individual dishes. Meanwhile, food culture has moved at the speed of TikTok — millions of people watch the same recipes go viral every week, with no way to actually eat them at a real restaurant.

Social Proof closes that gap. The menu is built entirely from viral recipes — dishes that earned millions of views on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube before they ever touched a plate. Every dish links to its viral origin video via QR code, so guests can watch where their food came from before they order it. Every dish is also rated publicly by guests, with live sales counts displayed alongside the stars. Dishes that don't earn their place get retired. New viral candidates take their spot. The menu is always getting better, and guests can watch it happen.

"We started with a simple question: if the internet already knows what food people love, why isn't any restaurant listening?" said Jake Corkin, founder of Social Proof. "We're not just building a restaurant. We're building a feedback loop — between what goes viral online and what earns a place on the menu, and between what guests actually think and what we actually serve. Most restaurants are afraid of honest feedback. We're built around it."

Guests at Social Proof browse a menu unlike any other. Each dish displays its star rating, how many were sold that week, and a QR code linking to the viral video that inspired it. After the meal, guests are invited to rate each dish they ordered — reviews go live immediately, with no curation and no delay. One spot on the menu is permanently reserved for "The Challenger" — a new dish on a 30-day trial, live-rated by guests, earning its place or getting retired at the end of the month. Over time, the menu evolves visibly. Guests come back to see what's changed.

"I watched the Dubai Chocolate Bar go viral on TikTok six months ago and kept thinking someone should just make it properly," said one guest at a preview dinner. "Then I found Social Proof. And then I rated it a five."

Social Proof is now open at 123 S Main Street in Salt Lake City, UT. Menus, hours, and live dish ratings are available at www.socialproof.com. Investors and restaurant operators interested in the Social Proof platform can reach out at info@socialproof.com.

## EXTERNAL FAQ

*Questions a guest or member of the press might ask.*

---

**1. What is Social Proof?**

Social Proof is a restaurant where every dish on the menu started as a viral recipe — sourced from TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and beyond — and every dish is rated publicly by the guests who eat it. We display live sales counts and star ratings on the menu, and we retire dishes that don't perform. The name means exactly what it says: the proof is in what people actually think, not what we tell you to think.

---

**2. Where do the recipes come from?**

We monitor food content across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms for recipes that genuinely resonate — dishes that earn millions of views because people actually want to eat them. Our culinary team then adapts those recipes for restaurant-quality execution. The viral video stays on the menu as context: every dish has a QR code linking back to where it came from, so guests can watch the original before they order.

---

**3. Do you have permission from the creators whose recipes you use?**

Recipes themselves aren't protected by copyright, so we don't have a legal obligation to seek permission. But we reach out to creators whenever we put their dish on the menu — we want them to know, and where possible, we want them to benefit. Through our creator revenue share program, credited creators earn a percentage of every dish sold that's based on their recipe. This isn't something we have to do. It's something we think is right, and it makes for better relationships.

---

**4. How often does the menu change?**

There's no fixed schedule — dishes stay on the menu as long as they're earning it, measured by guest ratings and sales performance. In practice, we expect to retire and replace two to four dishes per month. The Challenger slot turns over monthly by design. We always announce retirements in advance so guests have a chance to say goodbye.

---

**5. Can I request a dish?**

Yes — and we take requests seriously. If you've seen a viral recipe and want to eat it at Social Proof, tell us. We can't promise every suggestion makes it onto the menu, but every suggestion goes into our review pipeline. The whole point is that the internet helps build this menu, and that includes our guests.

---

**6. How does ordering work — is it different from a normal restaurant?**

Ordering is straightforward: you order at the table, food comes out, you eat. The difference is in what you're looking at when you decide. The menu shows each dish's star rating, how many were sold that week, and a QR code to its viral origin video. You can order based on the data, based on the video, or based on what everyone else is having. That's the experience.

---

**7. What does it mean that ratings are "public"?**

Every review submitted at Social Proof is published immediately and visible to anyone on our menu app. No curation, no waiting period, no filtering for negativity. If a dish gets a two-star review, that review is live. We believe honest feedback — including negative feedback — makes the restaurant better. Hiding bad reviews is how restaurants keep serving bad dishes for years. We'd rather know.

---

**8. How do I leave a review for a dish?**

At the end of your meal, you'll receive a prompt — via the table QR code or a card from your server — inviting you to rate the dishes you ordered. It takes about 90 seconds. Your reviews go live immediately. There's no account required, though creating one lets you track your review history and earn early-reviewer badges on new dishes.

---

**9. What if I didn't like a dish — will my bad review actually matter?**

Yes. That's the entire point. A bad review at Social Proof isn't a complaint — it's a vote. We track dish performance over time, and consistent low ratings directly inform which dishes get retired. If the Cucumber Salad keeps getting threes, the Cucumber Salad is going away. Your feedback isn't going into a void. It's going into the menu.

---

**10. What is "The Challenger" slot?**

One spot on our menu is permanently reserved for a new dish on a 30-day trial. The Challenger is always something brand new — a viral recipe we're testing in the real world for the first time. Guests know going in that this dish might not survive. If it earns a 4.2 average or higher by end of month, it earns a permanent place on the menu. If it doesn't, we retire it and a new Challenger takes its spot. We announce the results publicly every month.

---

**11. Is the "sold this week" count really live?**

Yes. Sales counts update in real time via our point-of-sale integration. What you see on the menu reflects actual orders placed since the start of the current week. We think knowing that 412 people ordered the Smash Burger this week is useful information when you're deciding what to eat. It's also just interesting.

---

**12. How do you decide when a dish gets retired?**

We look at two signals: guest ratings and sales velocity. A dish with consistently low ratings is a retirement candidate regardless of how much it sells. A dish with strong ratings but low sales might just need better positioning — we look at that before pulling it. In general, the bottom 20% of the menu by rating is always under review. We aim to retire and replace two to four dishes per month — enough to keep the menu evolving without creating chaos in the kitchen.

---

**13. Can I see a dish's full rating history?**

On each dish's page in the menu app, you can see the current average rating, the total review count, and every individual review in chronological order. We don't currently display a rating trend over time — a chart showing how a dish's score evolved week over week — but that's on our roadmap. The full review history is always visible, including the critical ones.
