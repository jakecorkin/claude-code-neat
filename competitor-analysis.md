## Pricing Strategy Insights

### Our Advantage
- **Predictable flat-rate pricing** appeals to outfitters like Jake who run high-ticket hunts ($4,500 average)
- At $149/month, we cost less than 1% of a typical booking vs. competitors charging 2-10%
- No surprise fees eating into margins

### Messaging Opportunity
> "Other platforms take 5-10% of every booking. On a $4,500 hunt, that's $225-$450 gone.
> OutfitterPro is a flat $149/month—book unlimited hunts and keep 100% of your revenue."

### Consider Adding
- **"Pay nothing until you book" trial** (like Krytter) - removes risk for hesitant buyers
- **Annual discount** (like LodgeRunner's 20% off) - improves retention, cash flow
