# Product Requirements Document: OutfitterPro CRM

## Executive Summary

OutfitterPro is a specialized CRM platform designed for hunting outfitters and guides to manage their seasonal business operations, client bookings, and guide coordination in one centralized system.

## Problem Statement

Hunting outfitters and guides face unique challenges:
- Seasonal booking cycles with limited hunt windows
- Complex coordination between multiple guides, clients, and properties
